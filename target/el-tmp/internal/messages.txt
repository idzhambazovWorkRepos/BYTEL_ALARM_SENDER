INSTALLMSG000210    -   * The directories are for system use only and must not be changed in any way by a UNIX user.\n
INSTALLMSG000211    -   * On a High Availability system, the directories must be on a disk that is moved with the HA package.\n
INSTALLMSG000212    -   * There must be plenty of space (more than 1 GB) in the record data buffering directories in case of temporary problems with, for example, network connections.\n
INSTALLMSG000213    -   * Having more than one data buffering directory on separate physical disk drives improves the performance of process streams.\n
INSTALLMSG000214    -   * In a very busy Comptel EventLink system, the node control interface buffer directory must reside on a different physical disk than the record data buffering directories, otherwise the messages and audit trail information reported by nodes get delayed.\n
INSTALLMSG000215    -   Also, in a busy system the database storage files must not be on the same disk as the buffering directories.\n
INSTALLMSG000216    -   * The buffer directory node control interface must reside on a different disk partition than the data buffering directories.\n
